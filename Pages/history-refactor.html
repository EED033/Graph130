            <p>"The Internet as we know it really got started in the early 1960s. That was when J.C.R. Licklider — a computer scientist with technology company Bolt, Beranek and Newman
                (BBN) — formulated a few unique ideas about global networking in a series of memos, describing an <b>"Intergalactic Computer Network."</b><br>
               His idea: link computers together across the globe; and anybody near a computer could share information. As it turns out, Licklider had the right idea at the right time. 
               The Cold War had the United States searching for a communication network that could survive a nuclear attack."<br>
